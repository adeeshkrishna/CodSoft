# Projects Overview

During this internship, I focused on five main projects:

- Titanic Survival Prediction: Predicting the survival of passengers based on demographic and socio-economic factors.
- Movie Rating Prediction: Predicting user ratings for movies based on features such as genre, actors, and budget.
- Iris Flower Classification: Classifying iris flowers into species based on sepal and petal measurements.
- Sales Prediction: Forecasting sales based on historical data and factors such as seasonality.
- Credit Card Fraud Detection: Identifying fraudulent transactions from credit card data to prevent financial loss.

# Project Details

# 1. Titanic Survival Prediction

  - Objective: To predict whether a passenger would survive the Titanic disaster based on features such as age, gender, class, etc.
  - Dataset: The dataset is sourced from Kaggle.
  - Approach:
     -  Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables).
     -  Feature engineering and scaling.
     -  Model training using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
     -  Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC score.
    
# 2. Movie Rating Prediction

  - Objective: To predict user ratings for movies based on features such as genre, director, budget, etc.
  - Dataset: MovieLens dataset.
  - Approach:
     -  Data cleaning and feature selection.
     -  Exploratory data analysis to understand trends.
     -  Building regression models, including Linear Regression and Decision Trees.
     -  Evaluating model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared.
  
# 3. Iris Flower Classification

  - Objective: To classify iris flowers into three species based on sepal and petal measurements.
  - Dataset: The well-known Iris dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository.
  - Approach:
     -  Data visualization to explore the dataset.
     -  Training classification models like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
     -  Evaluation using metrics such as accuracy and F1 score.

# 4. Sales Prediction

  - Objective: To forecast future sales based on historical data.
  - Dataset: Custom or sourced dataset for sales figures.
  - Approach:
     -  Data preprocessing and handling of time-series data.
     -  Feature engineering to add seasonality indicators.
     -  Model building using ARIMA, SARIMA, and/or machine learning models.
     -  Model evaluation using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

# 5. Credit Card Fraud Detection

  - Objective: To detect fraudulent transactions using a dataset of credit card transactions.
  - Dataset: Available on Kaggle.
  - Approach:
     -  Data preprocessing and handling class imbalance with techniques like SMOTE.
     -  Model training using algorithms such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks.
     -  Evaluation using precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix to assess model performance.
